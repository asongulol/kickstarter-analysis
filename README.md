Analysis of Kickstarter Data to Uncover Trends
### Challenge
Both in the US and in Great Britain, Kickstarters for Theater Campaigns are in general the most successful. Theater campaigns are the most numerous among the Kickstarter categories.
---
There are 525 successful theater campaigns in the US. In the Great Britain 604 campaigns were successful in the “plays” category. In Great Britain, the “plays” category is the most successful.
---
For successful campaigns, the mean goal is $5,049 dollars and the median goal is $3,000 dollars. For failed campaigns, the mean goal is $10,554 and the median goal is $5,000. Canceled campaigns, have an average goal of $682,065 with a median goal of $15,000. It appears based on this data that the success of the campaign is related negatively to the amount of the goal. Where the higher goal means less chances of success. Based on the standard deviation and the IQR there appears to be some failed Kickstarters campaigns that have extremely high goals.
---
Based on the box and whisker chart produced, mean campaign goal is around $4,000 therefore Louise would probably have a better chance of success if she produced her play for less than $4,000. The lower quartile of pledges starts on the x-axis showing that campaigns for musicals in Great Britain got no funding at all.
---
Looking at the table entitled Outcomes Based on Launch Date, Kickstarters are most successful in May and least successful in December. In addition, the success rate is greater than 90% for campaigns started in May and goes down to about 30% in December. It is recommended that Louise start her campaign to take advantage of this trend.

The table entitled Outcomes Based on Goals shows the relationship of the funding goals and the percentage of campaigns that either became successful or failed. Based on this table, it appears the most successful campaigns in the category “plays” are those which request less than $1000 (76% are funded successfully). Coming in second, are the “plays” that requested from between $1000 and $4,999. Based on this data, Louise should budget within this range for best chances of success. This reinforces the box and whisker chart referenced above.
---
The data has several limitations, one is that it only contains outdated data with the latest launch dates being in 2017. Due to this, it might have missed current trends in funding of Kickstarter campaigns. Second, it does not consider the results of campaigns that were currently marked as “live” in the dataset. Thirdly, no conversions of currencies were completed which of course results in unequal values in the funding goals.
---
Additional relationships, tables and charts that could be considered are the following:
---
1. success and failures related to a campaign being a "staff pick",
2. success and failures related to the number of backers,
3. success and failures related to the average donations.
